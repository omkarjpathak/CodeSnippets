DORI: DevOps Research Initiative

Purpose: Project DORI intends to automate the various research processes that
are currently handled manually. We are going to implement the processes using
CWL workflows. There will be a separate workflow for each pipeline namely
mapping, SNV and InDel detection, SV and coverage. There would be QC step at
the end of each stage. We are using BWA for mapping, the CWL script covers the
workflow and yml file has the information about the inputs and outputs.

bwa-mem.cwl: CWL workflow to run BWA for mapping
mem-mapper.cwl: Split fastqs into chunks, map, merge the mapped bams together,
	remove duplicates, sort the sequences with co-ordinates.
mem-mapper-pe.yml: Input/outputs for the CWL workflow.
