pcheck: Pipeline Check

Purpose: Utility to monitor the status of the submitted pipelines. The status
could be running, failed , finished or suspended. Along with the status, it
also displays the tartan run directory associated with the pipeline, date at
which the job was submitted on the cluster, project/subproject, analysis type,
samples in the analysis run and debug information. Pcheck uses the raptr 
database to check status of analysis and also needs access to the tartan
filesystem in order to create/move/delete analysis run directories.

tartan_run.py file manages the creation or tartan_run directories for analyses.
It creates various temporary files in the directory and monitors the status 
using the existence or non-existence of those files.
